# Introduction-to-the-machine-learning-project-that-delves-deeply-into-categories-algorithms-models


### With the goal to provide extensive and interesting, insightful and valuable knowledge on all four types of machine learning—supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning—I decided to delve deeply into everything connected to an Introduction to Machine Learning project in this project. Therefore, in order to make machine learning more sensitive and understandable for both machine learning beginners and those who wish to delve deeper into the field, I will go into great detail about various categories, techniques, methods, and models for machine learning. 


--------------


**Here, I've covered a general overview of exactly what they are, what kind of machine learning they are, and the tasks they can do.**

My primary goal is to conduct a thorough analysis of each of these categories, therefore I must provide a report with clear explanations, helpful examples, and information on which industries each of the designated categories may be applied to as well as where these kills can be implemented.

**. Explains the machine learning type with examples.**

**. Explores at least 3 types of algorithms within the category.**

**. Outlines a company/product that implements the machine learning type.**
