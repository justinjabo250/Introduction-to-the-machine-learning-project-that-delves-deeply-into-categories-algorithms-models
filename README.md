# Introduction-to-the-machine-learning-project-that-delves-deeply-into-categories-algorithms-models


With the goal to provide extensive and interesting, insightful and valuable knowledge on all four types of machine learning—supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning—I decided to delve deeply into everything connected to an Introduction to Machine Learning project in this project. Therefore, in order to make machine learning more sensitive and understandable for both machine learning beginners and those who wish to delve deeper into the field, I will go into great detail about various categories, techniques, methods, and models for machine learning. 





**. Explains the machine learning type with examples.**

**. Explores at least 3 types of algorithms within the category.**

**. Outlines a company/product that implements the machine learning type.**
